center of projection must always be at origin to make things easy. Then put camera vector space at 1 unit in the w direction away from origin, and put 4d shape with the closest point to the origin in the w-direction lying on the vector space.

Now, the projection of any point (a, b, c, d) from the shape onto the space is (a/d, b/c, c/d, 1)
d must always be >= 1
