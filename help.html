			<!-- <h1> Hello, there! </h1> -->
			<h1>Welcome, newcomer! This is 4Shadow.io, a simulation of a 4-dimensional hypercube. </h1>
			<!-- <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, visitor! It looks like you haven't been here before, so here's a bit of an explanation of all that stuff you saw on the other page.</p> -->

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you see on the simulation page is a projection of that hypercube,
				sort of like shining a light on it from above and looking at the shadow.
				In the real world, shadows are always two-dimensional. However, in the fourth dimension
				we can consider the possibility of 3-dimensional shadows.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has the benefit of looking incredibly cool. If you want to see more, here's how
				to use the site and play with some of the projection and display settings. First off, to get access to all of those
				settings click the settings icon in the top left corner of the simulation page. (If part of it is cut off, remember that it scrolls.)
			</p>
			<h1>Dragging rotation</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one's pretty intuitive. Click the figure and drag to rotate it in space. Sometimes it's a little confusing
			how it's being dragged, though, so I have a much more precise option:</p>

			<h1>Manual control (from the settings bar)</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, you can choose an exact degree angle to rotate the figure by, and on which pair of axes.
				For instance, if you would like to rotate it 1.5 radians counterclockwise on the xy plane, drag the xy slider
				to -1.5 and hit the "apply" button. You might notice that there are 6 sliders, 3 more than would be used for 3d rotations.
				That's because we have a new axis extending into the 4th dimension, the w-axis, which combines with the others to produce 3 extra planes for rotation.
			</p>
			<h1>Animation control</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, you can adjust the rotation and speed of the hypercube. The sliders are notated in radians per second,
				so if you want the hypercube to be rotating at 2 radians per second on the xw plane, move the xw slider to 1.5.
			</p>
			<h1>Geometry control</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This menu allows you to adjust how the projection is being displayed. By default, lines are represented by 20-sided polygon prisms,
				and points are represented by spheres. You can change the detail of the shapes, their thickness, their color, or enable wireframe mode.
			</p>
			<h1>Custom points</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one is quite cool, but it's still got some bugs that I'm working out. It lets you plot your own
				4-dimensional shapes and rotate them like the hypercube. To use it, just input the coordinates for 2 points and hit apply.
				The line connecting those points will be plotted in the simulation.
